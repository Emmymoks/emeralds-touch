          <h3>Joy Adejumoke Adedayo - Founder & CEO</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Joy Adejumoke Adedayo, I am the Founder of Emerald's
            Touch. What began as a love for colours and faces has turned into a
            professional journey of crafting confidence. With over 4 years of
            experience in bridal and editorial makeups, I blend technical skill
            with artistic intuition to create looks that complement each
            person's features and story.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Emerald's Touch I believe makeup is not a mask, it's a tool that
            empowers. Whether you're seeking a soft daytime glow, a classic
            editorial finish, or a flawless bridal transformation, I tailor
            products and techniques to your skin type and preferences. I
            prioritize hygiene, comfort, and longevity so your look not only
            photographs beautifully but feels effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm committed to serving clients in Lagos and Kwara State. Book a
            consultation and let's bring your vision to life — one face, one
            glam at a time ✨
